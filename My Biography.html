		<br>
		 I have <b>no problem with speaking in front of crowds </b> as I did with speaking among crowds. I guess thanks to my <b> high level of self-confidence</b>.
<br>
In addition, I have <b>no problem with working in groups</b>, I believe I am <b> good in cooperating</b> as I am very <b> commited and passionate</b> about completing any given task before its due date.
<br>
I <b> speak 3 languanges (Malay, English and Mandarin) fluently</b>.
<br>
Aside from language skills, I also <b> possess typing skills, documentation skills and basic computer skills </b>
<br>
<br>
As an ex-SMPP (Sekreteriat Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar) for two semester, I manage to learn some soft skills during the time, such as:
<b><ul>
	<li> Communication skills</li>
	<li> Problem solving skills</li>
	<li>Event management skills</li>
</b><br>
Oh, this is me by the way.
